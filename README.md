This repository contains the code and model weights for our U.C. Berkeley CS182 final project, "A Study of In-Context Learning for Periodic Functions."
# Guide to the Code

# How to Replicate
To replicate our findings, first upload the icl_new folder into the root of your Google drive. Then upload 'Transformer_Experiments.ipynb' to Google Colab, set the runtime to your choice of GPU, and run the cell sequentially up to the first training loop. If you would like to train models from scratch, run the training loops and skip over the model loading section. If not, skip the training loops and run the 'Load Models' section. Then proceed to run the rest of the cells sequentially.
